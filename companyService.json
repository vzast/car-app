There are several types of EAS technologies, including radio frequency (RF), acousto-magnetic (AM), and electromagnetic systems. Each type works by creating an electronic field between the detection gates. When an active tag enters this field without being deactivated at checkout, it disrupts the field and triggers an alarm. EAS systems rely on electronic tags or labels affixed to products. These tags come in different forms depending on the product type: hard tags are typically used on clothing and are removed by store employees after purchase; soft tags and labels are often applied to books, electronics, and other items and can be deactivated at the register; and source tagging, where EAS tags are embedded during the manufacturing process. The benefits of EAS include reducing shrinkage (losses due to theft), increasing profitability, providing valuable data about store traffic and product movement, and enhancing overall store operations and security strategies."
